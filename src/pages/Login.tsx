const TERMS_TEXT = `NYAYA AI — TERMS & CONDITIONS

Last Updated: September 2026

Welcome to NyayaAI. By creating an account or using NyayaAI, you agree to these Terms & Conditions. Please read them carefully before using the platform.

1. ABOUT NYAYAAI

NyayaAI is an AI-powered legal assistance platform designed to help users understand legal information, explore possible legal options, analyze documents, find relevant legal information, and connect with verified advocates.

NyayaAI is intended to make legal information more accessible and easier to understand. The platform does not replace a qualified advocate, lawyer, or other legal professional.

2. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

By creating an account, accessing, or using NyayaAI, you confirm that:

• You have read and understood these Terms & Conditions.
• You agree to follow these Terms & Conditions.
• The information you provide to NyayaAI is accurate to the best of your knowledge.
• You understand that AI-generated information may contain errors or omissions.
• You understand that NyayaAI does not guarantee any particular legal outcome.

If you do not agree with these Terms & Conditions, you should not create an account or use the platform.

3. AI-GENERATED LEGAL INFORMATION

NyayaAI uses artificial intelligence and legal datasets to generate responses and assist users with legal questions.

The AI system is designed to provide information based on available legal data, but it may sometimes produce incomplete, outdated, inaccurate, or incorrect information.

AI-generated responses should therefore be treated as general informational and educational guidance and should not be considered a final legal opinion.

Users should verify important legal information with a qualified advocate or legal professional before taking significant legal action.

4. NO GUARANTEE OF LEGAL OUTCOME

NyayaAI does not guarantee that using the platform will result in a successful legal outcome.

Legal cases depend on many factors, including facts, evidence, applicable laws, court procedures, opposing parties, judicial decisions, and the actions of legal professionals.

If a user loses a case after using NyayaAI, such loss does not mean that NyayaAI guaranteed that the case would be won.

NyayaAI should not be relied upon as the sole basis for making important legal decisions.

5. NO ADVOCATE-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP

Using NyayaAI does not automatically create an advocate-client, attorney-client, solicitor-client, or other professional legal relationship between the user and NyayaAI.

If you require professional legal representation or legal advice, you should consult a qualified and appropriately licensed advocate.

Any relationship between a user and an advocate contacted through NyayaAI is subject to the separate terms and professional responsibilities applicable to that advocate.

6. USER PROFILE AND PUBLIC INFORMATION

NyayaAI may allow users to create profiles and connect with advocates or other users.

Certain profile information may be displayed to other users when necessary for the operation of the platform.

For example, information such as a user's display name, profile picture, general location, professional information, or other information specifically designated as public may be visible to other users.

NyayaAI does not intend to publicly display private information such as passwords, authentication credentials, or other sensitive personal information.

Users should carefully consider what information they choose to place in their public profile.

7. PERSONAL DATA AND PRIVACY

NyayaAI may collect information necessary to create and operate an account and provide platform services.

This may include information such as:

• Name
• Email address
• Country or general location
• Profile information
• Documents or information voluntarily provided by the user
• Information required to provide platform functionality

NyayaAI will handle personal information according to its Privacy Policy and applicable laws.

Users should not submit passwords, financial credentials, highly sensitive personal information, or information belonging to another person unless there is a legitimate reason and the platform specifically requires it.

8. USER-PROVIDED CONTENT

Users are responsible for the information, documents, questions, and other content they submit to NyayaAI.

You agree not to intentionally submit:

• False or fraudulent information
• Malicious software or harmful code
• Content that violates applicable laws
• Another person's private information without authorization
• Content intended to abuse, threaten, harass, or harm others

Users should also ensure that they have the necessary rights or permission to upload documents or other materials to the platform.

9. LEGAL DOCUMENT ANALYSIS

If NyayaAI analyzes a document uploaded by a user, the analysis is provided as AI-generated informational assistance.

The system may fail to identify important clauses, deadlines, risks, exceptions, or legal issues.

Users should have important legal documents reviewed by a qualified legal professional when appropriate.

10. FINDING AND CONNECTING WITH ADVOCATES

NyayaAI may provide features that allow users to discover or connect with advocates.

Where advocate verification is provided, verification does not constitute a guarantee of the advocate's future conduct, performance, legal strategy, or outcome of a case.

Users are responsible for evaluating and deciding whether to engage an advocate.

NyayaAI is not responsible for the independent professional advice, actions, omissions, or decisions of an advocate.

11. PLATFORM AVAILABILITY

NyayaAI aims to keep the platform available and functioning reliably, but uninterrupted availability cannot be guaranteed.

The platform may occasionally be unavailable because of maintenance, technical problems, updates, security incidents, third-party services, or other circumstances.

Features may also be changed, suspended, or discontinued when necessary.

12. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

NyayaAI may use third-party services for functions such as authentication, hosting, analytics, payments, communication, or other technical services.

The availability and operation of such services may depend on their respective providers.

13. PROHIBITED USE

You must not use NyayaAI to:

• Commit or facilitate illegal activity
• Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the platform
• Interfere with the security or operation of the platform
• Upload malware or malicious code
• Impersonate another person
• Abuse or harass advocates, users, or platform staff
• Attempt to obtain another user's private information
• Use the platform for fraudulent purposes
• Circumvent security, access controls, or usage restrictions

14. ACCOUNT SECURITY

You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.

You should immediately notify NyayaAI if you believe that your account has been accessed without authorization.

NyayaAI is not responsible for losses resulting from a user's failure to properly protect their account credentials, except where liability cannot legally be excluded.

15. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

The NyayaAI platform, including its software, branding, design, interface, logos, original content, and other platform materials, may be protected by applicable intellectual property laws.

You may use the platform only for its intended purposes and may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse engineer, or commercially exploit platform materials without appropriate authorization, except where permitted by law.

16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, NyayaAI and its operators, employees, affiliates, and service providers will not be responsible for losses or damages arising from:

• Reliance on AI-generated legal information
• Errors or omissions in AI-generated responses
• Legal decisions made by users based on information provided by the platform
• The outcome of a legal case
• Actions or omissions of an advocate
• User-provided information that is inaccurate or incomplete
• Temporary platform unavailability
• Third-party services or systems

Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit liability that cannot legally be excluded or limited under applicable law.

17. USER RESPONSIBILITY

Users are responsible for making their own decisions regarding legal matters.

Before taking important legal action, users should consider obtaining advice from a qualified advocate or other appropriate professional.

NyayaAI is a tool for legal information and assistance, not a substitute for professional legal representation.

18. ACCOUNT SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION

NyayaAI may suspend or terminate an account where reasonably necessary, including when a user:

• Violates these Terms
• Misuses the platform
• Attempts to compromise platform security
• Engages in fraudulent or unlawful activity
• Abuses other users or advocates

Users may also stop using the platform at any time.

19. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS

NyayaAI may update these Terms & Conditions from time to time.

When significant changes are made, NyayaAI may provide appropriate notice through the platform or other available communication methods.

Continued use of the platform after updated Terms become effective may constitute acceptance of the updated Terms, subject to applicable law.

20. GOVERNING LAW

These Terms & Conditions will be governed by the applicable laws and regulations relevant to NyayaAI and the user's use of the platform.

Where required by applicable law, disputes may be subject to the jurisdiction of the appropriate courts or dispute-resolution mechanisms.

21. IMPORTANT LEGAL DISCLAIMER

NyayaAI provides AI-powered legal information and assistance for general informational and educational purposes.

NyayaAI does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or applicability of every response.

AI-generated information should not be treated as a substitute for professional legal advice.

If you are dealing with an urgent, serious, or complex legal matter, you should consult a qualified advocate.

22. CONTACT

If you have questions about these Terms & Conditions, privacy, account usage, or the NyayaAI platform, please contact us through the Contact section of the website.

By creating an account and using NyayaAI, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms & Conditions.`
